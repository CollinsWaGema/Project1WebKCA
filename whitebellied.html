                The white-bellied go-away bird has a call that sounds like 'go-way'. It has grey plumage, a white belly, and a huge crest on the top of its head. It also has white marks on its tail, which are visible when the bird is in flight.<br><br>
White-bellied go-away birds live in the arid savannahs and woodlands of Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia, and Ethiopia. The IUCN lists this bird as least concern, with no major threats to its survival.
